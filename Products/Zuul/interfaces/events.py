        Get a list of ranges describing contiguous blocks of events with a
        certain state.

        For example, in this one-column table:

            A
            A
            A
            B
            B
            A
            B
            B
            B

        The 'A' ranges are [[1,3], [6,6]], and the 'B' ranges are
        [[4,5],[7,9]].

        This is achieved by keeping a running total number of rows (@row in
        query_tpl below), and marking those rows where the eventState switches
        from one to another (@idx in query_tpl below). Selecting that from a
        subquery that selects the actual events (given filters and sort) yields
        the row number and event state of the first row of each contiguous
        block of events:

            ((1L, 0), (345L, 1), (347L, 0))

        One can then determine the ranges (in the above example, the new (0)
        events are at indices [[1,344],[347,END]] where END is the total number
        of rows).

        Calculating the total number of rows returned by the innermost subquery
        might be costly, so we return a single-member range and let the browser
        fill in the total, which it already knows, as the subquery necessarily
        also describes the current state of the grid.
