#               
# description: Zenoss is a monitoring program written by Zenoss, Inc.
#
# Most of the time this script simply delegates to
# ${ZENHOME}/bin/zenoss to actually execute the requested command
# (start/stop).  But, in some situations it behaves differently.  
#
# This script also checks for the fresh_install or upgraded flags.  If
# they are present the script will delegate to the pre/post-install or
# upgrade scripts as appropriate.  A normal chain of events is
# documented below:
#
# <fresh install>
# zenoss_init_pre
# zenoss start
# zenoss_init_post
# ... time goes by ...
# zenoss stop
# <upgrade occurs>
# zenoss_upgrade_pre
# zenoss start
# zenoss_upgrade_pos
#

# environment variables
# NB: Please keep the ZENHOME='**ZENHOME**' idiom alive in the src.  Tags
#     of this nature are sed substituted at build time based upon the package type.
